# A Simple Todo TUI Written in C++

This program allows the creation, deletion and modification of todo items inside the terminal.

Note: Cannot be compiled as is, you must add a directory for todo items to be stored in first (full path).

It displays current todo items, and also checks to see if there are none left:

Limitations:
$EDITOR is used for the editing function, so make sure to have it defined inside your current session!
As my c++ knowledge is fairly basic, the creation and deletion of items in done through parsing commands into the shell, however I might be able to improve it in some other way.
